"""
FileSlack offers methods to read, write and
clear the slackspace of a given file in FAT filesystems
Implementation is mainly realized as described by [1], but
extended in terms of respecting RAM slack padding of Windows
and Linux FAT implementations [2].

:Example:
>>> f = open('/dev/sdb1', 'rb+')
>>> fs = FileSlack(f)
>>> filenames = [ 'afile.txt' ]
to write something from stdin into slack:
>>> metadata = fs.write(sys.stdin.buffer, filenames)
to read something from slack to stdout:
>>> fs.read(sys.stdout.buffer, metadata)
to wipe slackspace of a file:
>>> fs.clear(metadata)
