An Experimental Framework for Data Hiding 

weever is an experimental toolkit for filesystem based data hiding techniques, implemented in Python. It collects various common exploitation methods, that make use of existing datastructures on the filesystem layer, for hiding data from conventional file access methods. This toolkit is intended to introduce people to the concept of established anti-forensic methods associated with data hiding.
